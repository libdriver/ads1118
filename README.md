## LibDriver ADS1118

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/ads1118/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The ADS1118 is a precision, low power, 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that provides all features necessary to measure the most common sensor signals in an ultra-small, leadless X2QFN-10 package or a VSSOP-10 package. The ADS1118 integrates a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), voltage reference, oscillator and high-accuracy temperature sensor. These features, along with a wide power supply range from 2 V to 5.5 V, make the ADS1118 ideally suited for power- and spaceconstrained, sensor-measurement applications. The ADS1118 can perform conversions at data rates up to 860 samples per second (SPS). The PGA offers input ranges from ±256 mV to ±6.144 V, allowing both large and small signals to be measured with high resolution. An input multiplexer (MUX) allows to measure two differential or four single-ended inputs. The high-accuracy temperature sensor can be used for system-level temperature monitoring or coldjunction compensation for thermocouples.

LibDriver ADS1118 is a full-featured driver for ADS1118, launched by LibDriver. It provides continuous reading, single reading, multi-channel sampling switching, temperature reading and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver ADS1118 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver ADS1118 SPI platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver ADS1118 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver ADS1118 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver ADS1118 offline document.

/datasheet includes ADS1118 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface SPI platform independent template and finish your platform SPI driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_ads1118_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float s;

res = ads1118_basic_init(ADS1118_MODE_ADC, ADS1118_CHANNEL_AIN0_AIN1);
if (res != 0)
{
    ads1118_interface_debug_print("ads1118: basic init failed.\n");         

    return 1;

}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    res = ads1118_basic_read((float *)&s);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        ads1118_interface_debug_print("ads1118: basic read failed.\n");
        (void)ads1118_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    ads1118_interface_debug_print("ads1118: adc is %0.4fV.\n", s);
    ads1118_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...

}

...
    
(void)ads1118_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_ads1118_shot.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float s;

res = ads1118_shot_init(ADS1118_MODE_ADC, ADS1118_CHANNEL_AIN0_AIN1);
if (res != 0)
{
    ads1118_interface_debug_print("ads1118: shot init failed.\n");         

    return 1;

}

...
    
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    res = ads1118_shot_read((float *)&s);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        ads1118_interface_debug_print("ads1118: shot read failed.\n");
        (void)ads1118_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    ads1118_interface_debug_print("ads1118: adc is %0.4fV.\n", s);
    ads1118_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    
    ...

}

...
    
(void)ads1118_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
